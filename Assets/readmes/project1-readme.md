# 1-DIY MagSafe Charger

A compact, custom-built wireless charger with MagSafe-style magnetic alignment, designed and assembled as a DIY project.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to repurpose a low-cost wireless charger and integrate it into a compact, custom case while adding magnetic alignment. The result is a functional, space-efficient wireless charger suited not only for iPhones, but any devices with a magnetic ring and wireless charging support.

## Materials

- Low-cost wireless charger (~CAD 5)  
- Super glue  
- 3D printer and filament  
- Discarded iPhone case **with an existing MagSafe magnetic ring**

---

## Process

The project was completed in several stages:

1. **Disassembly of the wireless charger**  
   - Removed the outer casing to expose the internal copper coil and electronic components.

2. **Design and 3D printing of a new case**  
   - Created a more compact casing using CAD software.  
   - Multiple iterations were required to achieve the correct dimensions.

3. **Assembly of the custom case**  
   - Secured the two halves of the 3D-printed case using super glue.

4. **Integration of the MagSafe magnetic ring**  
   - Recovered the magnetic ring from the discarded iPhone case.  
   - Super-glued the ring onto the custom case.

5. **Testing**  
   - The final assembly successfully charged devices with wireless charging support and magnetic alignment.

## Outcome

The completed charger is fully functional, compact, and aesthetically integrated with existing accessories. This project highlights skills in **electronics handling, 3D design, and prototyping**.
